# Custom Demo Generator - Industry Adaptation Guide

A step-by-step guide for customizing the Snowflake Intelligence analytics demo for different industries and customer use cases.

## üéØ Overview

This guide documents the proven process for adapting our analytics demo from one industry to another. We successfully transformed a perfume/scent analytics system into a furniture sales analytics platform, demonstrating how to create compelling, customer-specific demos quickly and effectively.

## üìÅ Demo Repository Structure

All Solution Engineering demos should be organized in our centralized GitHub repository:

**Repository**: [https://github.com/sfc-gh-rkrause/SE_DEMOS](https://github.com/sfc-gh-rkrause/SE_DEMOS)

### Creating a New Demo Folder

1. **Navigate to the SE_DEMOS repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfc-gh-rkrause/SE_DEMOS.git
   cd SE_DEMOS
   ```

2. **Create your industry-specific folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir "Your Industry Name"
   cd "Your Industry Name"
   ```

3. **Follow the standard demo structure**
   ```
   Your Industry Name/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # Industry-specific documentation

## üîÑ Industry Transformation Process

### Real Example: Perfume ‚Üí Furniture Sales

Here's the exact process we used to transform our perfume analytics demo into a furniture sales demo:

#### Step 1: Product Portfolio Mapping

**Original (Perfume)**:
```sql
scent_names = [
    "Sea Salt Blossom",
    "Spiced Oak & Apple", 
    "Golden Amberleaf",
    "Harvest Thyme",
    "Frosted Juniper",
    "Vanilla Cedarlight",
    "Meadow Bloom",
    "Citrus Petal",
    "Rainleaf",
    "Lavender Honeycomb",
    "Lemon Verbena Grove",
    "Peachwood Breeze"  -- Trending product
]
```

**Transformed (Furniture)**:
```sql
furniture_names = [
    "Executive Oak Desk",
    "Modern Sectional Sofa",
    "Rustic Dining Table", 
    "Ergonomic Office Chair",
    "Industrial Bookshelf",
    "Scandinavian Coffee Table",
    "Memory Foam Mattress",
    "Vintage Leather Armchair",
    "Glass Top End Table",
    "Upholstered Storage Bench",
    "Adjustable Standing Desk",
    "Velvet Accent Chair"  -- Trending product
]
```

**Process**:
1. **Map 1:1 Product Relationships**: Each perfume matched to a furniture item
2. **Maintain Product Count**: Keep same number for statistical consistency  
3. **Preserve Trending Logic**: Keep the same trending product pattern
4. **Industry-Relevant Names**: Choose realistic, industry-specific product names

#### Step 2: Business Context Adaptation

**Comment Templates - Before (Perfume)**:
```python
positive_templates = [
    "Customers love the {scent} fragrance, praising its {adj1} scent and {adj2} foam quality.",
    "Reviews highlight {scent}'s {adj1} aroma and {adj2} moisturizing properties.",
    "Many users comment on how {scent} leaves their hands feeling {adj1} and {adj2}.",
]
```

**Comment Templates - After (Furniture)**:
```python
positive_templates = [
    "Customers love the {furniture} design, praising its {adj1} construction and {adj2} build quality.",
    "Reviews highlight {furniture}'s {adj1} craftsmanship and {adj2} comfort features.",
    "Many users comment on how {furniture} fits {adj1} in their space and feels {adj2}.",
]
```

**Process**:
1. **Replace Industry Terms**: scent ‚Üí design, aroma ‚Üí craftsmanship, etc.
2. **Update Adjectives**: refreshing ‚Üí sturdy, aromatic ‚Üí comfortable
3. **Change Context**: hands feeling ‚Üí space fitting, moisturizing ‚Üí comfort
4. **Maintain Template Structure**: Keep same parameterization logic

#### Step 3: Review Topics Classification

**Original Classification Topics**:
```sql
['Scent', 'Packaging', 'Quality', 'Price', 'Shipping']
```

**Updated Classification Topics**:
```sql
['Design', 'Quality', 'Comfort', 'Price', 'Shipping']
```

**Process**:
1. **Industry-Specific Topics**: Scent ‚Üí Design, add Comfort for furniture
2. **Keep Universal Topics**: Quality, Price, Shipping remain relevant
3. **Update AI Prompts**: Modify Cortex AI classification accordingly

#### Step 4: Social Media Content Transformation

**Before (Perfume Social Posts)**:
```json
{
  "text": "Absolutely love the Peachwood Breeze! Smells like summer in a bottle üçëüåø",
  "username": "wellness.by.kate"
}
```

**After (Furniture Social Posts)**:
```json
{
  "text": "Absolutely love the Velvet Accent Chair! Perfect for my reading nook üõãÔ∏è‚ú®", 
  "username": "home.design.kate"
}
```

**Process**:
1. **Product Name Swap**: Direct 1:1 replacement
2. **Context Adaptation**: "summer in a bottle" ‚Üí "perfect for my reading nook"
3. **Username Themes**: wellness ‚Üí home design
4. **Emoji Updates**: üçëüåø ‚Üí üõãÔ∏è‚ú®

### Step 5: Seasonal Pattern Adjustment

**Perfume Seasonality**:
```python
"Lavender Honeycomb": {"spring": 1.2, "summer": 1.5, "fall": 1.0, "winter": 0.7}
```

**Furniture Seasonality**:
```python
"Scandinavian Coffee Table": {"spring": 1.2, "summer": 1.5, "fall": 1.0, "winter": 0.7}
```

**Process**:
1. **Map Seasonal Patterns**: Apply similar seasonal logic to equivalent products
2. **Industry Logic**: Furniture sales peak during moving season (spring/summer)
3. **Holiday Adjustments**: Back-to-school, Black Friday patterns
4. **Regional Variations**: Climate-based preferences

## üõ†Ô∏è AI-Powered Customization with Cursor

### The Cursor Approach

We used **Cursor AI** to accelerate the transformation process. Here's how:

#### Effective Prompts for Industry Transformation

**Prompt 1: Initial Transformation**
```
"Please keep this code exactly the way it is but instead of the data being about 
perfume sales and scents swap the data to be about furniture sales"
```

**Prompt 2: YAML Alignment**  
```
"Now update the following yaml files to match the data we generated above as 
product_sales_analysis.yaml, product_inventory.yaml, product_comments_and_stats.yaml"
```

**Prompt 3: Consistency Check**
```
"PLEASE KEEP THE YAML FILES THE SAME AS THEY WERE JUST UPDATE THEM to match 
the new furniture data"
```

#### Best Practices for AI-Assisted Transformation

1. **Be Explicit About Structure Preservation**: Emphasize keeping code structure unchanged
2. **Provide Clear Context**: Specify the industry transformation clearly
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Make small, focused requests rather than large changes
4. **Consistency Validation**: Always verify alignment across all files
